        <p>Pharmacy is the science and practice of discovering, producing,
           preparing, dispensing, reviewing and monitoring medications, aiming to ensure the safe, effective,
           and affordable use of medicines. It is a miscellaneou
           science as it links health sciences with pharmaceutical sciences
           and natural sciences. The professional practice is becoming
                more clinically oriented as most of the drugs are now
                 manufactured by pharmaceutical industries. Based on
                  the setting, pharmacy practice is either classified
                   as community or institutional pharmacy.</p>

            Most articles, if written correctly, are evergreen,
             which means once created, they will drive increasing
              results over time. These articles can also be repurposed

                Main article: Pharmacy technician
                Pharmacy technicians support the work of pharmacists and other
                 health professionals by performing a variety of pharmacy-related
                  functions, including dispensing prescription drugs and other medical
                   devices to patients and instructing on their use. They may also perform administrative duties in pharmaceutical practice, such as reviewing prescription requests with medic's offices and insurance companies to ensure correct medications are provided and payment is received.
                Legislation requires the supervision of certain pharmacy technician's
activities by a pharmacist. The majority of pharmacy technicians work in communit
pharmacies. In hospital pharmacies, pharmacy technicians may be managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT in hospital pharmacy has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and
                 specialized areas in pharmacy practice allowing
                  pharmacists the time to specialize in their expert field as
                   medication consultants spending more time working with
                    patients and in research. Pharmacy technicians are
                     registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council 
                     (GPhC). The GPhC is the regulator
                 of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and pharmacy premises
                In the US, pharmacy technicians perform their duties 
                under the supervision of pharmacists. Although they may
                 perform, under supervision, most dispensing, compounding
                  and other tasks, they are not generally allowed to perform 
                  the role of counseling patients on the proper use of their
                   medications. Some states have a legally mandated
                    pharmacist-to-pharmacy technician ratio</p1>
